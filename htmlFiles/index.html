to make comments we use: angle brackets <!-- this is a comment -->
<!-- doctype says that the document is an html document

html tags will represent the root element of html page

head tags will contain information about the webpage 
title is the title of the page 

body element contains visible content of your webpage
h1 defines a large heading 
p represents paragraph text

if we have two paragraph defining texts; they are automatically 
    separated by line breaks 

if we want extra line breaks we can use <br> tag which is a 
    self closing tag.
hr will add a horizontal line across the page.  

if we add any new lines and any line breaks over here in text it isnt
    visible on website.
but if we want it to follow the format we are typing in over here we can 
    use pre tags instead of p tags.

<!-- 
What is a hyperlink? 
it is a digital reference to data that a user can follow by clicking or tapping 
a button or a link

To create a hyperlink:
we need <a> </a> tags 
1. href attribute that is a name value pair that modifies the 
behaviour of an element 
2. target is another attribute that will:
if we set the target to "_blank" then the link will open in a new tab
3. title is another attribute that will set what is visible when the mouse
hovers over the link before clicking it

we can have absolute urls and relative urls. 
let us link two html pages together using another hyperlink
we can do that by using a tags and passing the name of the file if we are in 
the same project. eg: href = "lyrics.html"

how to add images to our webpage:
we use an img tag and put the link of the image in src; we can set the height=""
and width="" 

how to add audio files: 
we need audio tags
we can use the attributes: controls autoplay muted loop

how to include a video that has mp4 format: check vid.html

how to apply a favicon to your website? navigate to favicon.html
