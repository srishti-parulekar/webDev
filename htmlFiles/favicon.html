<!-- The meta charset tag in HTML specifies the character 
encoding for the document. Character encoding defines 
how charactersare represented in the document, ensuring
that text displays correctly.

 "UTF-8" is the character encoding being specified. 
UTF-8 is a widely-used encoding that supports a wide range
of characters from various languages and is the recommended
encoding for HTML documents.

The meta http-equiv tag in HTML is used to provide information
to the browser or server about how the web page should be
handled or interpreted. It stands for "HTTP equivalent"
and allows you to specify HTTP headers within an HTML
document.

One common use of the meta http-equiv tag is to specify 
the Content-Type header, which tells the browser the MIME 
type of the document. This is particularly useful if the 
server is not configured to send the correct Content-Type 
header, or if you want to override it for some reason.

#MAKE THE WEBPAGE ADJUST TO DEVICES OF ALL SIZES
The <meta name="viewport"> tag is used to control the 
layout and behavior of the viewport on mobile devices. 
The viewport is the visible area of a web page displayed 
on a device's screen, and its size can vary depending on 
the device's screen size and resolution.

1. width=device-width: This setting sets the width of the 
viewport to be equal to the width of the device's screen. 
This ensures that the content of the web page will adjust 
to fit the screen width of the device.

2. initial-scale=1.0: This setting sets the initial zoom 
level when the page is first loaded. A value of 1.0 means 
that the page will be displayed at its original size without 
any zooming applied.
